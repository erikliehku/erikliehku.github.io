Hello, this is Lie Jen Houng (李仁鴻). You may also call me Erik.
I am born in Hong Kong and have been studying and working here since then for 30 years.

I studied in the Chinese University of Hong Kong from 2009-2013 on Actuarial Science.
After graduation, I worked in AXA and Deloitte as Actuarial Analyst and Consultant, and got my actuarial fellowship in 2016 from the Society of Actuaries (FSA).

In 2018, I decided to leave the actuarial industry and started a new career in cryptocurrency.
I have since then worked in Crypto.com both in the data team and research team.
At the same year, I have also started my part time study in the University of Hong Kong, major in computer science.

My research interest include general cryptocurrency study, decentralized finance, central bank digital currencies, cryptocurrency regulation, cryptocurrency insurance and graph learning on bitcoin transaction graph.
